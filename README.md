# COVID-19 diagnosis from CT images based on Transfer Learning approach
Computer aided diagnosis of COVID-19 using transfer learning of pre-trained neural network

This tutorial notebook explains about the development of COVID diagnosis system based on `Transfer Learning` of pre-trained deep neural network specifically VGG16. 

This work is inspired from the GitHub repository which could be found in this URL: <https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT> 

It has the dataset of CT images taken from COVID-19 patients and also Non-COVID subjects. Unlike the original implementation, this tutorial uses VGG16 for transfer learning of COVID features from CT images.
